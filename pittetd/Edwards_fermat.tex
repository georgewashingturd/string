{\bf Page 8, Problem 3}. Show that if $d^2|z^2$ then $d|z$, start with $\gcd(d,z) = c$
%
\nbea
d^2 k & = & z^2 \\
c^2 D^2 k & = & c^2 Z^2 \\
D^2 k & = & Z^2
\neea
%
we know that $\gcd(D,Z) = 1$ and so $\gcd(D^2,Z^2) = 1$, since $k|Z^2$, if $\gcd(D^2,k) > 1$ then $\gcd(D^2,Z^2) > 1$ as well, therefore $\gcd(D^2,k) = 1$, this means that $k = K^2$ by our assumption that if $vw = u^2$ and $v$ and $w$ are co-prime then both $v$ and $w$ are squares.

Substituting $k=K^2$ back into our first equation
%
\nbea
d^2K^2 & = & z^2 \\
\to dK & = & z
\neea
%
thus $d|z$ although I'm not sure about this particular line of reasoning, since $\gcd(D^2,Z^2) = 1$ and $D^2|Z^2$ then $D^2 = 1$ and we immediately get $k=Z^2$ and we don't need our assumption about $vw=u^2$ at all. But I'm not sure how else to show that $\gcd(D^2,k) = 1$ except by showing that $\gcd(D^2,Z^2) = 1$.

Now, the one step I stil need to prove, is that $\gcd(D,Z) = 1$ means $\gcd(D^2,Z^2) = 1$, again, without using the fundamental theorem. What I need is Bezout, assume that $\gcd(D^2,Z^2) = g > 1$ then Bezout tells us that
%
\nbea
D^2 a + Z^2 b & = & g
\neea
%
but from $\gcd(D,Z)=1$ we also get
%
\nbea
D A + Z B & = & 1 \\
\to DgA + ZgB & = & g
\neea
%
Now there might be some other numbers such that
%
\nbea
D M + Z N & = & g
\neea
%
but this means either that $\gcd(M,N) = g$ or $\gcd(M,N) = y | g$, let's dicuss the latter first
%
\nbea
D y M' + Z y N' & = & yg' \\
D M' + Z N' & = & g'
\neea
%
with $\gcd(M',N') = 1$ but this means that $\gcd(D,Z) = g'$, the only way this works is that $g' = 1$ and $\gcd(M,N) = g$, but if this is the case then
%
\nbea
D M' + Z N' & = & 1
\neea
%
but Bezout also tells us that all solutions to $D A' + Z B' = 1$ are of the form see ent.pdf Problem 2.5
%
\nbea
A' & = & A + l D \\
B' & = & B - lD
\neea
%
Equating the two Bezouts $g = D^2 a + Z^2 b = DgA' + ZgB'$
%
\nbea
\to gA' & = & gA + gl D = Da\\
\to gB' & = & gB - gl Z = Zb 
\neea
%
Now, equating the two Bezouts again
%
\nbea
D^2 a + Z^2 b & = & DgA + ZgB \\
D(Da - gA) & = & Z(gB - Zb) \\
\to D(glD) & = & Z(glZ) \\
D^2 & = & Z^2
\neea
%
which is a contradiction, therefore if $\gcd(D,Z) = 1$ then $\gcd(D^2,Z^2) = 1$ as well. The above proof is easily generalizable to $\gcd(D^n,Z^m)$
%
\nbea
\to gA' & = & gA + gl D = D^{n-1}a\\
\to gB' & = & gB - gl Z = Z^{m-1}b 
\neea
%
Now, equating the two Bezouts again
%
\nbea
D^n a + Z^m b & = & DgA + ZgB \\
D(D^{n-1}a - gA) & = & Z(gB - Z^{m-1}b) \\
\to D(glD) & = & Z(glZ) \\
D^2 & = & Z^2
\neea
%

{\bf Page 14, Problem 1}. Prove that if $Ad^2$ is a square then $A$ is a square, using the result from previous Problem, say $Ad^2 = z^2$ since $d^2|z^2$ this also means that $d|z$ so we can write $z = dk$, therefore
%
\nbea
Ad^2 & = & z^2 = d^2k^2 \\
A & = & k^2
\neea
%
and we are done.

{\bf Page 14, Problem 2}. Show that $x^4 - y^4 = z^2$ has no non-zero integer solutions. One thing we should not do is to blindly apply the Pythagorean formula ($m^2-n^2, 2mn, m^2+n^2$) over and over again, what we should do is follow what was done in the preceding section.

In that section we have $p,q,$ and $p^2 - q^2$ are all squares due to $t^2 = pq(p^2-q^2)$ so if we designate
%
\nbea
p & = & x^2 \\
q & = & y^2 \\
p^2 - q^2 & = & z^2 \\
\to x^4 - y^4 & = & z^2
\neea
%
and we have our current problem. Following what was done in the book
%
\nbea
z^2 & = & p^2 - q^2 \\
& = & (p-q)(p+q)
\neea
%
since $p$ and $q$ are co-prime so are $p-q$ and $p+q$. From $x^4 - y^4 = z^2$ we know that $x$ and thus $p$ is odd but here we can have $y$ even or odd, for simplicity let's start with $y$ and thus $q$ even so that we have the case in the book, so
%
\nbea
p + q = r^2  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ p - q = s^2
\neea
%
with both $r$ and $s$ odd and co-prime and
%
\nbea
u = \frac{r - s}{2}   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ v = \frac{r + s}{2}
\neea
%
with $u$ and $v$ integers and co-prime and so
%
\nbea
uv & = & \frac{r^2 - s^2}{4} = \frac{(p+q)-(p-q)}{4} = \frac{q}{2} = \frac{y^2}{2}
\neea
%
since $uv$ integer $y^2/2$ must also be an integer, thus $y = 2k$, $y^2/2 = 2k^2$ therefore
%
\nbea
\frac{uv}{2} & = & \frac{y^2}{4} = k^2 \\
\to uv & = & 2k^2
\neea
%
since $u$ and $v$ are co-prime this means that one of them is even and the other odd, let's take $u$ odd and $v=2v'$ even, then $u(2v') = 2k^2$ and therefore
%
\nbea
u = U^2   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ v = 2 V^2
\neea
%
since $u$ and $v$ are coprime. Thus
%
\nbea
r & = & u + v = U^2 + 2V^2
\neea
%
and 
%
\nbea
u^2 + v^2 & = & \frac{(r-s)^2 + (r+s)^2}{4} \\
& = & \frac{2r^2 + 2s^2}{4} = \frac{r^2 + s^2}{2} \\
& = & \frac{(p+q) + (p-q)}{2} = \frac{2p}{2} \\
& = & p \\
u^2 + v^2 & = & x^2
\neea
%
Thus we have a primitive triple $u,v,x$ (because $u,v$ are co-prime), thus we have $P^2-Q^2,2PQ,P^2+Q^2$ (note that above we have designated $u$ as the odd one) and so
%
\nbea
\frac{uv}{2} = k^2 = (P^2 - Q^2)PQ
\neea
%
so we have the same situation as $t^2 = pq(p^2-q^2)$ but $uv/2 = q/4 < t^2$ and our infinite descent begins.

The above was when $q$ even such that $p-q$ and $p+q$ are odd. Now we deal with the case of $q$ odd such that $p-q = 2r^2$ and $p+q = 2s^2$ are both even, this is because now $p-q$ and $p+q$ are no longer co-prime so we cannot follow the same steps above.

What we have is (from the pythagorean triple formula)
%
\nbea
p = x^2 & = & m^2 + n ^2 \\
q = y^2 & = & m^2 - n^2
\neea
%
thus we can use them directly, $m^2$ plays the role of $p$ and $n^2$ play the role of $q$ as they are already co-prime and of opposite parities and of course $x$ plays the role of $p+q$ and $y$, $p-q$. Thus in this case
%
\nbea
u = \frac{x-y}{2} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ v = \frac{x+y}{2}
\neea
%
Thus, just like above
%
\nbea
uv = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{4} = \frac{n^2}{2} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ u = U^2 ~~~~~~ v = 2V^2
\neea
%
and therefore
%
\nbea
u^2 + v^2 = m^2
\neea
%
Thus we have our infinite descent all over again.












{\bf page 25, Problem 1}. Prove that $2^{37}-1$ is not prime














{\bf Page 25, Problem 2}. If $p = 4n+3$ divides $x^2 + y^2$ then
%
\nbea
(x^2)^{2n+1} + (y^2)^{2n+1} & = & \left\lbrack (x^2) + (y^2) \right\rbrack \left\lbrack (x^2)^{2n} - (x^2)^{2n-1}(y^2)  +(x^2)^{2n-2}(y^2)^2 \cdots + (y^2)^{2n} \right\rbrack
\neea
%
and hence $p|(x^2)^{2n+1} + (y^2)^{2n+1}$ as well. But
%
\nbea
(x^2)^{2n+1} & = & x^{4n+2} = x^{p-1}
\neea
%
and so if $p\nmid x$ and $p\nmid y$ then because $p|x^{p-1} - 1$ and $p|y^{p-1} - 1$ we have
%
\nbea
(x^2)^{2n+1} + (y^2)^{2n+1} & = & (x^{p-1} - 1) + (y^{p-1} - 1) + 2 \\
& = & pm_x + pm_y + 2 \\
& = & pm_{xy} + 2
\neea
%
therefore we have a contradiction as now $p$ no longer divides $(x^2)^{2n+1} + (y^2)^{2n+1}$ as it differs from a multiple of $p$ by 2. But if one of them, either $x$ or $y$ is divisible by $p$ then (for simplicity let's assume it's $x$)
%
\nbea
(x^2)^{2n+1} + (y^2)^{2n+1} & = & pm_x + (y^{p-1} - 1) + 1 \\
& = & pm_x + pm_y + 1 \\
& = & pm_{xy} + 1
\neea
%
and this time it differs from a multiple of $p$ by 1.

{\bf Page 33, Problem 2}. This is quite a fun one to do, let's do the one for $A = 13$, we start with
%
\nbea
1^2 - A \cdot 0^2 & = & 1
\neea
%
multiplying it with $r^2 - A = s$ we get
%
\nbea
r^2 - A(1+r)^2 & = & 1\cdot s
\neea
%
here $k=1$, so now we need to find an $r$ such that $r^2 < A$ but $r^2 - A$ is a negative number, here since $k=1$ we do not need to care if $k|(1+r)$ or not. The answer is $r=3$ such that $s = r^2 - A = -4$ and our next equation is
%
\nbea
3^2 - A \cdot 1^2 = -4
\neea
%
multiplying it by $r^2 - A = s$ we get
%
\nbea
(3r + A)^2 - A(3 + r)^2 & = & -4 \cdot s
\neea
%
but now we need to make sure $k = -4$ divides $(3+r)$, an $r$ that works is $r=1$ this way $r^2 < 13$ and $r^2 - A = -12$ is negative and so we get
%
\nbea
4^2 - A\cdot1^2 = 3
\neea
%
next, multiplying it with $r^2 - A = s$ again
%
\nbea
(4r + A)^2 - A(4+r)^2 & = & 3\cdot s
\neea
%
here $k = 3$, to make sure $3|(4+r)$ and since $r^2 < 13$ we get $r=2$ and thus
%
\nbea
7^2 - A\cdot 2^2 = -3
\neea
%
and I got tired after this :) so the $s$ we recovered so far are $1,-4,3,-3, \dots$

{\bf Page 33, Problem 3}. The first part is straightforward, since $p^2 - Aq^2 = k$ and $P^2 - AQ^2 = K$ with $P = (pr + qA)/|k|$ and $Q = (p + qr)/|k|$
%
\nbea
pQ & = & \frac{p^2 + pqr}{|k|} \\
Pq & = & \frac{pqr + q^2A}{|k|} \\
\to pQ - Pq & = & \frac{p^2 - Aq^2}{|k|} \\
& = & \pm 1
\neea
%
as $|k| = |p^2-Aq^2|$ by definition. Now for the more fun part, since $pQ - Pq = \pm1$, Bezout tells us that $\gcd(Q, P) = 1$, but from $P^2 - AQ^2 = K$, if $\gcd(Q,K) > 1$ then it will also divide $P$ and vice versa, therefore these three are co-prime.

We need this for the next step, we want a new number $R$ such that $QR + P$ is divisible by $K$ or in other words
%
\nbea
QR + P & \equiv & 0 \pmod{K} \\
R & \equiv & Q^{-1}(-P) \pmod{K}
\neea
%
we are guaranteed to have such a $Q^{-1}$ because $\gcd(Q,K) = 1$ and the final step is also straightforward, say
%
\nbea
W \equiv QA + PR & \equiv & QA + P(Q^{-1}(-P)) \pmod{K} \\
W & \equiv & QA - Q^{-1} P^2 \pmod{K} \\
QW & \equiv & Q^2A - P^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{K}
\neea
%
and by definition $K|Q^2A - P^2$ but since $\gcd(Q,K) = 1$ this means that $W \equiv QA + PR \equiv 0 \pmod{K}$ and we are done.

{\bf Page , Problem 1}. Show that the only integral solutions to $1 + x + x^2 + x^3$ being a square is $x = -1,0,1,7$. First some factorization
%
\nbea
1 + x + x^2 + x^3 & = & (1 + x + x^2) + x^3 \\
& = & (1 + x)^2 - x + x^3 = (1 + x)^2 - x(1-x^2) \\
& = & (1 + x)^2 - x(1+x)(1-x)\\
& = & (1 + x)\lbrack(1 + x) - x(1-x)\rbrack = (1 + x)\lbrack1 + x - x + x^2\rbrack \\
& = & (1+x)(1+x^2)
\neea
%
From here we can conclude that $x$ cannot be even unless $x=0$, here's how, we know that $A^2 = (1+x)(1+x^2)$ 
and suppose that $d$ is the common factor of $(1+x)$ and $(1+x^2)$, therefore $d$ also divides
%
\nbea
(1+x)^2 - (1+x^2) & = & 2x
\neea
% 
thus $d|2$ or $d|x$. But here $x$ is even, thus $1+x$ is odd, do $d$ can't divide 2, so $d|x$ but since $d|(1+x)$ and $x$ and $1+x$ are co-prime, $d=1$. This means that 
%
\nbea
1 + x & = & y^2 \\
1 + x^2 & = & z^2
\neea
%
the last equation means $z^2 - x^2 = 1$ but the difference between two squares cannot be one unless $x=0$. Thus is $x$ is even then $x = 0$.

Next is $x$ odd. Let's recast $x = 2m+1$, we then have
%
\nbea
A^2 = 1 + x + x^3 + x^3 = (1+x)(1+x^2) & = & (1 + 2m + 1)(1 + (2m + 1)^2) \\
& = & 2(m+1)(4m^2 + 4m + 2) \\
& = & 4(m+1)(2m^2 + 2m + 1) \\
\to A^2 & = & 4(m + 1)(m^2 + (m+1^2))
\neea
%
Let's divide out the factor of $4$ and we have
%
\nbea
A'^2 & = & (m + 1)(m^2 + (m+1)^2)
\neea
%
any factor of $m+1$ and $m^2 + (m+1)^2$ would also divide $m^2$ but $m+1$ and $m^2$ are co-prime thus $(m+1)$ and $m^2 + (m+1)^2$ are co-prime thus each of them is square
%
\nbea
m + 1 & = & w^2 \\
m^2 + (m+1)^2 & = & y^2
\neea
%
since $m$ and $m+1$ are co-prime, $m^2 + (m+1)^2 = y^2$ forms a primitive Pythagorean triple, therefore we can cast it in the usual form, but here we have two choices, either $m$ is even or $m$ is odd. First, let's tackle the $m$ even
%
\nbea
m & = & 2ab \\
m + 1 & = & a^2 - b^2 = w^2
\neea
%
since from above we know that $m+1$ is square and 
%
\nbea
(m + 1) - m = 1 & = & a^2 - b^2 - 2ab \\
1 & = & (a-b)^2 - 2b^2

This is a form of Pell's equation and I was messing around with Pell's equation for roughly two days until I found out that I don't need to mess with Pell's equation at all. We'll talk about Pell's equation later :)

What we need here is to note that since $m + 1 = w^2 = a^2 - b^2$, so it forms another Pythagorean triple, since $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, they are also primitive
%
\nbea
a & = & c^2 + d^2 \\
b & = & 2cd
\neea
%
therefore the Pell's equation we had earlier becomes
%
\nbea
1 & = & (a-b)^2 - 2b^2 \\
& = & (c^2 + d^2 - 2cd)^2 - 2(2cd)^2 \\
& = & (c-d)^4 - 8(cd)^2
\neea
%
we now do the oldest trick in the book, substitutions
%
\nbea
s = c + d ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ t = c - d
\neea
%
therefore $st = c^2 - d^2$ and
%
\nbea
s + t = 2c ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ s - t = 2d
\neea
%
and
%
\nbea
(s + t)(s - t) = s^2 - t^2 & = & 4cd \\
\to \frac{s^2 - t^2}{4} & = & cd
\neea
%
making the substitution
%
\nbea
1 = (c-d)^4 - 8(cd)^2 & = & t^4 - 8\left(\frac{s^2 - t^2}{4}\right )^2 \\
1 & = &  t^4 - \frac{1}{2}\left(s^2 - t^2\right )^2 \\
\to 2 & = & 2t^4 - \left(s^2 - t^2\right )^2
\neea
%
at this point I was quite stuck until I tried the simplest solution, the quadratic formula, solving for $s$ we get
%
\nbea
s & = & \pm \sqrt{t^2 \pm\sqrt{2}\sqrt{t^4 - 1}}
\neea
%
for $s$ to have a chance to be an integer we need $\sqrt{2}\sqrt{t^4 - 1}$ to be an integer, therefore
%
\nbea
t^4 - 1 & = & 2Q^2 \\
(t^2 - 1)(t^2 + 1) & = & 2Q^2
\neea
%
but $t = c - d$ and $c$ and $d$ are of opposite parities, thus $t$ is odd and $\gcd(t^2 - 1, t^2 + 1) = 2$ thus one of $t^2 - 1$ and $t^2 + 1$ is a square and the other is 2 times a square but either way we cannot have $t^2 \pm 1$ equal a square unless $t = 0$ or $t = \pm1$. But from the original Pell's equation $2 = 2t^4 - (s^2 - t^2)$ if $t = 0$ we have no solution for $s$. If $t=\pm1$ then $s = \pm1$ as well (or $\mp 1$).

But from $s = c + d$ it has to be positive (remember that $c$ and $d$ are part of a Pythagorean triple), thus $s = 1$, so one of $c$ or $d$ must be zero. From $b = 2cd$ we have $b = 0$ and the original Pell's equation gets to
%
\nbea
1 & = & (a - b)^2 - 2b^2 \\
& = & (a - 0)^2 - 2 \cdot 0^2 \\
\to 1 & = & a
\neea
%
and from $m + 1 = w^2 = a^2 - b^2$ we have $m + 1 = 1$ and $m = 0$ and from $x = 2m + 1$ we have $x = 1$. Thus we so far had $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ as solutions.

Next, we tackle $x = 2m + 1$ odd with $m$ odd, thus like the previous case
%
\nbea
m & = & a^2 - b^2 \\
m + 1 & = & 2ab = w^2
\neea
%
and they obey a (negative) Pell's equation just like above
%
\nbea
m + 1 - m = 1 & = & 2ab - (a^2 - b^2) \\
& = & 2b^2 - (a - b)^2
\neea
%
since $a$ and $b$ are co-prime we have either $a = 2A^2$ and $b = B^2$ or $a = A^2$ and $b = 2B^2$ but if it is the latter then from the Pell's equations
%
\nbea
1 & = & 2b^2 - (a - b)^2 \\
& = & (2B)^2 - (A^2-2B^2)^2
\neea
%
but again, the difference of two squares cannot be one unless $2B = 1$ and $A^2 - 2B^2 = 0$ but this is impossible since $A$ and $B$ are integers, therefore $b = B^2$ and $a = 2A^2$ and we have
%
\nbea
1 & = & 2B^4 - (A^2 - 2B^2)^2
\neea
%
again I was messing with Pell's equations again but again it was not needed, quadratic formula to the rescue! solving for $B$ we get
%
\nbea
B & = & \pm \sqrt{-2A^2 \pm\sqrt{8A^4 + 1}}
\neea
%
for $B$ to be an integer we must have $8A^4 + 1$ to be a square, on the outset it is nothing more than just a Pell's equation but we can do better, borrowing the trick I used in solving $y^2 = x^3 + 1$, we do the following
%
\nbea
8A^4 + 1 & = & k^2 \\
8A^4 & = & k^2 - 1 \\
& = & (k - 1)(k + 1) \\
\to 8A^4 & = & n(n + 2)
\neea
%
where $n = k - 1$. We know that $\gcd(n, n+2)$ is at most $2$ but since the LHS is $8A^4$ it must be 2 :) So we need to distribute the prime factors of $8A^4$ into $n$ and $n + 2$ and since $\gcd(n,n+2) = 2$ we must have either
%
\nbea
n = 2C^4 ~~~~~~ n + 2 = 2^{4r + 2}D^4 ~~~~~~~~{\rm or} ~~~~~~~~n = 2^{4r + 2}D^4  ~~~~~~ n + 2 = 2C^4
\neea
%
the $2^{4r + 2}$ is to make sure that when we multiply $n$ and $n + 2$ we get an overall factor $8$, also from their difference $n + 2 - n = 2$ we get (including the two cases)
%
\nbea
\pm2 & = & 2C^4 - 2^{4r + 2}D^4 \\
\to \pm 1 & = & C^4 - 2E^4, ~~~~~ E^4 = 2^{4r}D^4
\neea
%
at this point we will generalize things, since we can think of $1 = 1^4$, I wanted to see if there are solutions to the following equations
%
\nbea
2E^4 = C^4 + F^4 ~~~~~~~~~~{\rm and} ~~~~~~~~~~~2E^4 = C^4 - F^4 
\neea
%
Now, if $C$ and $F$ are both even, then we can cancel an overall factor of $2^4$ throughout (the same with any common factor between them), and if after canceling they still contain $2$ we can do the same until we reach a point where $C$ and $F$ are both odd and co-prime. They must be both odd because the LHS is even.

So we can just consider co-prime solutions with $C$ and $F$ odd. Since they are both odd
%
\nbea
C + F = 2u  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C - F = 2v \\
C = u + v    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ F = u - v
\neea
%
with $u$, $v$ of opposite parities and co-prime since their sum (and difference) is odd and $C$ and $F$ are co-prime. Now tackling the first case $2E^4 = F^4 + C^4$ we get
%
\nbea
2E^4 & = & (u + v)^4 + (u - v)^4 \\
\bcancel{2}E^4& = & \bcancel{2}(u^4 + 6u^2v^2 + v^4) \\
E^4 & = & (u^2 + v^2)^2 + (2uv)^2
\neea
%
but since $u$ and $v$ are co-prime and of opposite parities they form a Pythagorean triple
%
\nbea
(u^2 - v^2)^2 + (2uv)^2 & = & (u^2 + v^2)^2 \\
(u^2 - v^2)^2 & = & (u^2 + v^2)^2 - (2uv)^2
\neea
%
multiplying both of them
%
\nbea
(E^2)^2 (u^2 - v^2)^2 & = & \left \lbrack (u^2 + v^2)^2 + (2uv)^2 \right \rbrack \left \lbrack (u^2 + v^2)^2 - (2uv)^2 \right \rbrack \\
\left \lbrack (E^2) (u^2 - v^2) \right \rbrack^2 & = & (u^2 + v^2)^4 - (2uv)^4
\neea
%
but we know that $Z^2 = Y^4 - X^4$ has no non-trivial solutions, the only trivial solutions are all zeroes (which we cannot have here since $Y = u^2 + v^2$), the other trivial solution $Z = 1$ and $Y=1$ with $X = 0$.

This means that $2uv = 0$ so either $u=0$ or $v = 0$ or both (but we can't have both zero because we need $Y = u^2 + v^2$ to be 1). But from $C = u + v$ and $F = u - v$, if one of them is zero we have $C = \pm F = \pm 1$, either way, from $2E^4 = C^4 + F^4$ we have $E = 1$.

And from $n = 2C^4 = 2, n + 2 = 4E^4 = 4$ (or the other way round) we get $8A^4 = n(n+2) = 8$, meaning $A = 1$. And from $B = \pm \sqrt{-2A^2 \pm\sqrt{8A^4 + 1}}$, we get $B = \pm 1$ which in turn means $m = a^2 - b^2 = 4A^4 - B^2 = 3$ and $m + 1 = 2ab = 4A^2B^2 = 4$, this translates to $x = 2m+1 = 7$.

The other case is $2E^4 = C^4 - F^4$, again subtituting $C = u + v$ and $F = u-v$
%
\nbea
2E^4 & = & (u + v)^4 - (u - v)^4 \\
& = & 8uv(u^2 + v^2) \\
\to E^4 & = & 4uv(u^2 + v^2)
\neea
%
now $u$ is co-prime to $u^2 + v^2$ and $v$ is also co-prime to $u^2 + v^2$ also $u^2 + v^2$ is odd so it is also co-prime to $4$, therefore $4uv$ is co-prime to $u^2 + v^2$, thus
%
\nbea
4uv & = & H^4 \\
u^2 + v^2 & = & I^4
\neea
%
but $u$ and $v$ are co-prime and of opposite parities, say $v$ is odd, from $4uv = H^4$ we must have $v = V^4$ and from the second equation we therefore have $u^2 + (V^2)^4 = I^4$ but again $Z^2 = Y^4 - X^4$ has only trivial solutions. Again the all zero solution is out because then $u = v = 0$ but they must be of opposite parities.

The other trivial solution is $Y = I = 1 \to v = 1$ and $Z = v = 0$ and $X = u = 1$, this means $C = u + v = 1$ and $F = u - v = 1$ and $2E^4 = C^4 - F^4 = 1 - 1 = 0 \to E = 0$, which means one of $n$ or $n + 2$ is zero, which also means $8A^4 = n(n + 2) = 0 \to A = 0$ and $B = \pm \sqrt{-2A^2 \pm\sqrt{8A^4 + 1}} = \pm 1$. This means that $m = a^2 - b^2 = 4A^4 - B^2 = -1$ and $m + 1 = 2ab = 4A^2B^2 = 0$ and $x = 2m+1 = -1$ and this is FINALLY our last solution LOL.



Since $t = c - d$
